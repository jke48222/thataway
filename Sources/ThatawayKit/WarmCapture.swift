/// Screen capture, measured three ways.
///
/// The brief budgets 50 ms for hotkey→frame and warns that `SCStream` session
/// setup is a hidden 300–800 ms tax, so the stream must be kept warm. That is
/// a claim worth testing rather than inheriting, so this file implements all
/// three plausible paths and the bench times them head to head:
///
///  1. `/usr/sbin/screencapture` — what WindowPet actually shipped. A process
///     spawn per frame. The baseline to beat.
///  2. `SCScreenshotManager.captureImage` — the macOS 14+ one-shot. No stream
///     to keep alive, so if it lands inside budget the whole warm-stream
///     apparatus is unnecessary complexity.
///  3. A warm `SCStream` that keeps the newest complete frame in hand.
///
/// The non-obvious part of (3): ScreenCaptureKit does **not** deliver frames
/// on a timer. When the screen is static it emits `.idle` frames with no
/// pixels, so "wait for the next frame after the hotkey" can block for an
/// unbounded time on a still screen — the exact situation a coach faces,
/// since the user is staring at the UI they're asking about. The correct
/// design is therefore to retain the last `.complete` frame and use it
/// immediately: if nothing has changed, a frame from 3 seconds ago is still
/// a perfect likeness. `frameAgeMs` reports that staleness so it is a stated
/// property rather than a silent assumption.

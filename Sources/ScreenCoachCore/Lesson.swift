/// and I'll wait — and I'll know when you've done it." Every step therefore

/// tree, so advancing is evidence-driven rather than a timer or a Next button.

/// wrong for anyone slower than its author; one that advances on a Next button
/// cannot tell whether you did the thing or just clicked Next. The tree can
/// see the dialog open and the value change, so the coach can too — and it is
/// nearly free, because the cache is already re-reading on AXObserver events.

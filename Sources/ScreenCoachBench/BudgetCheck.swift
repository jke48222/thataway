/// tested; this measures the real stages on the real machine and fails the
/// build when one drifts over.

/// It exits non-zero on violation so it can sit in CI unattended. Stages that
/// cannot be measured headlessly are reported as unmeasured rather than
/// silently passed — an unmeasured stage is not a met budget.
